AutoIt Script to brute force Koyo PLC DL240

To complile the AU3 file install AutoIt tools from https://www.autoitscript.com

This is a proof of concept. It is testing 10 to the power of 7 values (10,000,000). The pilot PC was able to do about 30 values a minute without optimizations. If initial value is not A but 0 then double the brute force estimates!
